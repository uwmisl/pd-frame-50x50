PurpleDrop 50x50 Top Plate Frame
================================

Frame kit for building drop surfaces with a 50x50mm top plate. 

The kit comes with two parts: 

The kit comes in two parts: 

- The "frame" holds the PET film dielectric, and locates the glass plate
- The "cover" is screwed on to hold the top plate in place, and make electrical contact to it.

Each part is designed as PCB in KiCad, and can be built at any PCB manufacturer using the gerber files attached in releases.

# Parts

Two COTS parts are added to the cover: 

    - Conductive gasket - [Laird Technologies 4245PA51H01800](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/laird-technologies-emi/4245PA51H01800/2175938) - A 1mm thick, 3mm wide strip of foam gasket in conductive fabric. This serves to create pressure on the top plate, and to make contact to the ITO coating via copper tape.
    - Header pin - A single, right angle header, like [Sullins GBC01SBSN-M89](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/GBC01SBSN-M89/862318) or similar
